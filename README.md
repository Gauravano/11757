# Centralized Attendance System

### Ministry: Government of Delhi		

### Category: Software

### Problem Statement :

PWD Delhi has employee strength of approx. 3500 employees, which is scattered in different offices located all over Delhi. More than 40% are engineers, who visit site office directly and spent most of the daytime in the field/site. A web-based and mobile based solution is required by which all the employees can mark their attendance at any place including the facility to mark in time and out time at different locations and multiple time in a day. The system will capture their location and timing and information will be transferred to the centralized server. Controlling officer will be able to check their staff, which is 
under their jurisdiction and help in tracking the performance of the employee.
